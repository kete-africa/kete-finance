# Spec 006 — Kete Finance's settings on Kete's declarations

A6 of Kete's release (doctrine D-060: « aucune app ne lit plus sa devise ou sa langue dans une
variable d'environnement »; kete-core decision 0013, specs 115 to 117). Run on the author's go of
2026-10-17 (« vas au bout »).

## Why

Kete Finance read the currency of new documents — quotes, invoices, requests, advances, accounts from `FINANCE_CURRENCY`: one value for every organization of a
deployment, set by whoever deploys, unknown to the Compte Kete where the organization says its own.

  R --> C[kete.currency of a new document]
```

## Requirements

- **FR-001 — The currency is `kete.currency`**, resolved where the command runs: as Kete Finance sets it
  for the organization (`kete_settings`, journaled), else as the organization set it in the Compte
  Kete, else F CFA. A document keeps the currency it was written in. `FINANCE_CURRENCY` is gone.
- **FR-002 — The Compte Kete is read at each page**: her theme and preferences come from there
  (they follow her in every app), and the organization's layer is kept for its commands.
- **FR-003 — Storage**: the migration `kete_settings` with its RLS policy and its journal
  (`@kete/settings`).

## Proof

- A quote written while the app sets « GHS » is in GHS; taken back, the next one is in F CFA.

## Not done here

« Réglages » in the app's frame comes with the common frame (`@kete/shell`, step C3): until then
the organization sets its currency in the Compte Kete (Mon espace › Paramètres).
