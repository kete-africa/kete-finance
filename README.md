# kete-gestion

A Kete App, born complete: it signs people in with the Compte Kete, keeps each organization's data
apart, journals every gesture, lets agents prepare and people decide — on its screens and in their
copilot (MCP Apps) — sends its e-mails and events from a worker, and passes CI on its first commit.
It is born with the roles of its trade, gestures whose broken rules are said in words, « Demander »,
WhatsApp and Telegram, usage counted for Kete Cockpit, logs, and a session a browser test can write
(kete-core spec 093).

## What it is born with

| Piece                                                                                       | Where                                                   | From                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| The roles of its trade: a member holds what her business role holds, as the owner ticked it | `src/platform/rights.ts`, migration `0004`              | `@kete/capabilities`                                 |
| A gesture whose broken rule comes back as its code, said in words                           | `src/platform/screen.ts`, `src/lib/errors.ts`           | `@kete/capabilities` (`performGesture`, `RuleError`) |
| « Demander »: a question answered with the readings she may open, nothing changed           | `src/features/assistant`, `/demander`                   | `@kete/agents`                                       |
| WhatsApp and Telegram: its own senders, consent, words, delivery, webhooks                  | `src/platform/chat.ts`, `/api/chat/*`, migration `0005` | `@kete/notify`                                       |
| Usage per organization, daily counts to Kete Cockpit                                        | `src/platform/usage.ts`, migration `0007`               | `@kete/analytics`                                    |
| Logs: JSON lines, redacted, traced                                                          | `src/platform/log.ts`                                   | `@kete/log`                                          |
| Form fields: a choice, a tick, a few lines, the notes under a form                          | the screens                                             | `@kete/design`                                       |
| A session a browser test writes, as the sign-in does                                        | `tests/complete.test.ts`                                | `@kete/auth` (`signSession`)                         |

## Run locally

```bash
# Once per machine: a GitHub token with read:packages, kept in your user configuration.
pnpm config set "//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken" <token>
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env   # then fill it: database, Compte Kete registration, session secret
pnpm db:migrate
pnpm dev               # http://localhost:3400
pnpm worker            # in another terminal: e-mails and events
```

## Test

```bash
pnpm test              # a Neon "test" branch, or KETE_TEST_POSTGRES=container
pnpm typecheck
```

## Deploy

The repository's secret `KETE_PACKAGES_TOKEN` (read:packages) lets CI read kete-core's packages;
the image receives it as the build secret `node_auth_token`. One image, two roles (doctrine
ARCHITECTURE_APP §9): the web process (`pnpm start`, migrations at
start-up) and the worker (`pnpm worker`). An operator registers the app at the Compte Kete
(client id and secret) and declares it in Kete Cockpit (its events key).

## Make it yours

1. Name it in `kete.json` and `messages/` (`app_name`), and fill its identity card there
   (`governance`, doctrine D-040): who answers for it, the data it handles (`personal`, `financial`,
   `payment`, `children`…), whether it calls AI models, and what an outage costs (`low` to
   `critical`). Kete's registry deduces from it the controls that apply.
2. Replace `src/features/tasks` with the first real feature, keeping its layers. Name the roles of
   its trade in `src/platform/rights.ts` (`businessRoles`) and in each permission's
   `businessRoles`; adapt « Demander »'s rules (`src/features/assistant/ask.ts`) to the trade.
3. Choose its design in `src/platform/app.ts` — `kete`, `workspace`, or its own (`design/`).
